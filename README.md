# CSHTML5.Tools.StubGenerator

This tool lets you create stubs for the 3rd-party referenced libraries used in your Silverlight projects.

The main purpose is to make the migration from Silverlight to the web via CSHTML5 easier by allowing you to replace your Silverlight 3rd-party libraries with JavaScrip-based implementations while maintaining your original Silverlight code unchanged.

For context and general information about the migration from Silverlight to the web via CSHTML5, please read [this page](http://cshtml5.com/links/migrate-silverlight-wpf-apps-to-html-javascript.aspx).


### Tutorial

To create stubs from your Silverlight 3rd-party referenced libraries, please follow these steps:

1. Make sure that CSHTML5 version 1.x is installed on your computer ([Download Link here](http://cshtml5.com/links/community-edition.aspx)). Even if you are using CSHTML5 version 2.x, you still need to have version 1.x installed to use the Stub Generator.

2. Download the source code in this repository and open the .SLN file with Visual Studio.

3. Launch the project "CSHTML5.Tools.StubGenerator.App". It is a WPF application. The following window will appear:

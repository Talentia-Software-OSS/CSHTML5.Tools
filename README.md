# CSHTML5.Tools.StubGenerator

This tool lets you create stubs for the 3rd party references used in your Silverlight projects.

The main purpose is to make the migration from Silverlight to the web via CSHTML5 easier by allowing you to replace your Silverlight 3rd-party libraries with JavaScrip-based implementations while maintaining your original Silverlight code unchanged.

For context and general information about the migration from Silverlight to the web via CSHTML5, please read [this page](http://cshtml5.com/links/migrate-silverlight-wpf-apps-to-html-javascript.aspx).
